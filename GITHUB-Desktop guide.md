## 🌟 What is GitHub Desktop?

GitHub Desktop is a simple app that connects your **local folder** (on your computer) with your **GitHub repository (online)**.

It helps us:
- Save code safely in one place.  
- Edit freely in **VS Code**.  
- Share updates with one click (no copy-paste or ZIPs).  
- Always keep everyone’s files up to date.

## ⚙️ 1️⃣ Install GitHub Desktop

1. Go to 👉 [https://desktop.github.com](https://desktop.github.com)  
2. Download for Windows (or macOS).  
3. Install it — it’s small and safe.  
4. Sign in with your GitHub account.  

💡 If you don’t have an account yet:  
- Go to [https://github.com](https://github.com) → click **Sign up**
